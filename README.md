# Resume Maker

- [Link](https://resume-maker-41z.pages.dev/)
- Issues: 
    - so the email isnt opening in a new tab...instead its routing to the localhost server
    - seperate scrolling for edit and resume
    - improve resume design on adding experience
    - try removing form data array...make it empty in app.js
- Version Updates:
    - add further forms:
        - Personal Details (add linkedin, github) 
   
    - use better font and bold...along with icons
    - store it into local storage
    - or add it into a db

- Planning Layout: 
    - projects, achievements, certifications and misc all are same components (only for projects there is a link)
